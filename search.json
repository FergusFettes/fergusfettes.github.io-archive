All sounds, even to the roaring of Lions, the screeching of the nightly Owls, the laments and groans of those entrapped in Hell, are as sweet Musick to her. All odours, even to the foulest stench of Corruption, are to her as the delight of roses and Lilies. All savours, even to the banquet-table of the Harpys of heathen lore, are as Sweet loaves and spiced Ale. Wandering at noon through the Waste-Places of the world, it seems to her she is refreshed by Canopies of flocking Angels. The earnest seeker will look for her in All places, however dim and sordid, of this world or in the seven others. Thrust a keen Sword-blade through her and it will \\seem as a fountain of Divine and Pure pleasure. \\These eyes, by Translation, have been given to see her ways; and an equal gift as revealed by Wisdom is sometimes granted the Child.” ~ Jane Lead1 ReviewsI have started reviewing things, cities first. This is a largely biographical account of places I have been and what I thought about them. I will add more as time goes on (I hope!) 1.My subtitle is plagiarised from the Borges book where I was introduced to her.
