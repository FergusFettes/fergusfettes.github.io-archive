# Summer 2012
I travelled through Europe for a summer, eventually hitchhiking from Budapest to London. I believe I was looking for somewhere to live.

## Berlin
## Dresden
## Prague
## Bratislava
## Budapest
## Berlin
## Leipzig

My first visit to Leipzig, where I would eventually live for many years. See [Leipzig](/Reviews/Places/Urban/Cities#Leipzig)
## Leipzig-London
