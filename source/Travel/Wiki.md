# New Travel Wiki
* using wikivoyage and wikitravel (and all their archives)
* using wikipedia and many other places
* using couchers.org, adding a button somewhere there for people to describe experiences
* getting the openstreetmap community involved? maybe some back and forth there?

All of this rewritten by ai at different scales-- this could even be an opportunity to use different hypertext protocols-- maybe AI can finally start using that one where you can zoom in on words/paragraphs and they fit seamlessly into the page?
