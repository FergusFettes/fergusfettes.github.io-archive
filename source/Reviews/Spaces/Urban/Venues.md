# Philipino Bands Singing in English
This is a genre popular throughout SE asia. [My father](/People/Brock_K_Fettes.md) would take us to these bars from time to time when we were children. I suppose these now-faraway dreamlike memories have had some lasting impression on me.

[Jumping the Shark](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/alex-cameron/jumping-the-shark/)-- an album about a washed-up crooner. This album always reminded me in a remarkably clear way of music bars in HongKong and the kind of tragic ex-pats that would end up there. I assume, being from [that part of the world](Australia:W!), that he has some familiarity with one or more of the many megacities over there.
