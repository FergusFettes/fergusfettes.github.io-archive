I have been meaning to write a [larger piece](/Megacity-Megaproject) about megacities for some time. In an effort to start making progresson that and to start gathering some material, I will start doing small autobiographical reviews of some megacities that have made an impression on me.

For now, I am defining a megacity as 'any city with a metro population at or above Paris/London as defined by [this pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20200802083106/http://www.demographia.com/db-worldua.pdf).[^Tianjin][^UNREAD]

[^Tianjin]: If that seems unecessary and unfair to Tianjin, I would say that in part the only reason I am including Paris and London on the list at all is they provide a relevant reference point for [certain people](/Reviews/People/Europeans), not because I think they are defining members of the megacity class.

# Tokyo-Yokohama
# Jakarta [memories]
Spent some time here as a child. I remember taxi rides through dusty highways between skyscrapers, and the [golden candle](National Monument (Indonesia):W!) in the center-- there was lots of [kite-flying](/Reviews/Spaces/Misc/Kites). We went to a [karaeoke](/Reviews/Spaces/Venues/Karaoke) bar and heard a philippino band singing american rock and roll-- probably the first live rock music I heard in my life was in bars in Jakarta.
# Delhi [memories, map]
# Mumbai [memories, map]
# Manila
# Shanghai [memories]
# Sao Paulo
# Seoul-Incheon
# Mexico City
# Guangzhou-Foshan [memories]
# New York [memories]
# Beijing [memories, footage?, opinions?]
The first city I lived in as an 'independent'[^dependent].

[^dependent]: I was still living off my parents money for the first few months, and off my [other privilidges](/Sins/Priviledge/English) for much longer.
# Cairo [memories, map, sleep, drink, eat, districts]
# Kolkata
# Moscow
# Bangkok [memories]
# Buenos Aires
# Shenzhen [memories]
# Dhaka
# Los Angeles
# Lagos
# Istanbul
# Osaka-Kobe-Kyoto
# Karachi
# Bangalore [memories, map]
# Tehran
# Kinshasa
# Ho Chi Minh City [memories]
# Rio de Janeiro
# Chennai [memories, map]
# Chengdu [memories]
# Lahore 
# Paris [memories]
# London [memories, map, eat, districts]

# Conclusions
I have spent well over a year in megacities-- a short time when compared to a random sample of the world population[^???].

[^???]: does this mean anything?

I have visited [16/34] of the worlds megacities. There are around 10 more that are high on my list which I should get to in the next decade. I think Moscow and Tehran are the only major difficulties-- but I am writing this in the time of the [Mahsa Amini protests](W!) so lets see.

I feel like there is a lot to be learned about megacities and I look forward to expanding this page.
