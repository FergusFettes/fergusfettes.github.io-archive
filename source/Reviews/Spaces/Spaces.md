# Urban
Urban spaces are where the density of people increase beyond a certain point[^TODO]. They are seperated into
[Megacities](/Reviews/Spaces/Urban/Megacities), [Cities](/Reviews/Spaces/Urban/Cities) and [Venues](/Reviews/Spaces/Urban/Venues)-- small spaces in larger spaces.

# Rural
Rural spaces are outside of these.

[^TODO] define this
