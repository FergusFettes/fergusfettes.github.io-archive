The room I took was vacated hastily due to a stabbing in the neighboring room. Perhaps 30 or 40 people lived there, some in apartments, some (like me) in rooms that opened onto the corridors generally, using some of the shared toilets and bathrooms in the building. The shared rooms often lacked luxuries like glass in the panes or locking doors. An example anecodte of many– when I moved in, the kitchen had recently been inexplicably cleaned. Someone had cooked a pot of cabbage. Over the course of the next six months, the pot of cabbage didn’t move– while different generations, different species of mould battled for dominance over the interior, first a luxuriant green furry mould, then lower-profiled blues came in and held sway. I went in there every morning at 6am to boil a liter of water for my daily thermos of coffee, but apart from that limited my contact with the surfaces and spaces.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Merseburger-95\"><a href=\"#Merseburger-95\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Merseburger 95\"></a>Merseburger 95</h3><p>Moved in with my partner[^piano] for a few months.

This was beyond him.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Dannis-House\"><a href=\"#Dannis-House\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Dannis House\"></a>Dannis House</h3><p>Moved in with an old street musician.
