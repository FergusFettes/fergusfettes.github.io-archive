        <p>I have been meaning to write a <a href="/Megacity-Megaproject">larger piece</a> about megacities for some time. In an effort to start making progresson that and to start gathering some material, I will start doing small autobiographical reviews of some cities that have made an impression on me.</p>
<p><a href="/Reviews/Spaces/Urban/Megacities">Megacities</a> have their own section.</p>
<h1 id="Beijing"><a href="#Beijing" class="headerlink" title="Beijing"></a>Beijing</h1><p>See <a href="/Reviews/Spaces/Urban/Megacities#Beijing">Beijing</a>.</p>
<h1 id="Aberdeen"><a href="#Aberdeen" class="headerlink" title="Aberdeen"></a>Aberdeen</h1><p>I don’t feel deeply inspired to review Aberdeen, but I did spend two years there <a href="/Education#Aberdeen">‘studying’</a> so I suppose I should do it some justice.</p>
<p>The best thing in Aberdeen (aside from the often <a href="/Reviews/Spaces/Venues/Misc#The_Market_Arms">ineffable</a>, <a href="/Reviews/Spaces/Venues/Misc#Chaplins">inexplicable</a> or <a href="/Reviews/Spaces/Venues/Misc#Screens">insufferable</a> bars) was the <a href="thin.cheat.curl:W3W!">abandoned paper mill in the center of the town</a>. Yes, I am saying my favourite thing in Aberdeen was an abandoned void in its center– though those are often my favourite places, so it isn’t an enormous inditement.</p>
<h1 id="Leipzig"><a href="#Leipzig" class="headerlink" title="Leipzig"></a>Leipzig</h1><p>I lived in Leipzig for around 5 years[^leipzig]. I visited Leipzig for two weeks in <a href="/Travel/Journeys#Summer-2012">July 2012</a>. I returned in 2013, thanks to the fact that there were <a href="/Travel/Technique#Volunteering">volunteering</a> opportunities in the town itself (they are more often found in farms and in the countryside in general), so I could live in the town for free while I continued my <a href="/Education#Open_University">studies</a>. </p>
<h1 id="Gestalt"><a href="#Gestalt" class="headerlink" title="Gestalt"></a>Gestalt</h1><p>Leipzig oh Leipzig! I had a wonderful time there, a fine little town. Not really a city I suppose, but it had more than enough to satisfy me at the time.</p>
<h2 id="Leipzig-Apartments"><a href="#Leipzig-Apartments" class="headerlink" title="Leipzig Apartments"></a>Leipzig Apartments</h2><h3 id="Pizzalab-George-Schwartz-Str"><a href="#Pizzalab-George-Schwartz-Str" class="headerlink" title="Pizzalab, George Schwartz Str."></a>Pizzalab, George Schwartz Str.</h3><p>Project house that I volunteered at (with my brother).</p>
<h3 id="Dancers-Sublet-Lindenauer-Markt"><a href="#Dancers-Sublet-Lindenauer-Markt" class="headerlink" title="Dancers Sublet, Lindenauer Markt"></a>Dancers Sublet, Lindenauer Markt</h3><h3 id="The-Castle-Duerenberger-Str"><a href="#The-Castle-Duerenberger-Str" class="headerlink" title="The Castle, Duerenberger Str."></a>The Castle, Duerenberger Str.</h3><h3 id="Merseburger-108"><a href="#Merseburger-108" class="headerlink" title="Merseburger 108"></a>Merseburger 108</h3><p>Sub-squat grade dwelling. The room I took was vacated hastily due to a stabbing in the neighboring room. Perhaps 30 or 40 people lived there, some in apartments, some (like me) in rooms that opened onto the corridors generally, using some of the shared toilets and bathrooms in the building. The shared rooms often lacked luxuries like glass in the panes or locking doors. An example anecodte of many– when I moved in, the kitchen had recently been inexplicably cleaned. Someone had cooked a pot of cabbage. Over the course of the next six months, the pot of cabbage didn’t move– while different generations, different species of mould battled for dominance over the interior, first a luxuriant green furry mould, then lower-profiled blues came in and held sway. I went in there every morning at 6am to boil a liter of water for my daily thermos of coffee, but apart from that limited my contact with the surfaces and spaces.</p>
<h3 id="Merseburger-95"><a href="#Merseburger-95" class="headerlink" title="Merseburger 95"></a>Merseburger 95</h3><p>Moved in with my partner[^piano] for a few months. However she enjoyed having more space, so I soon tried to find ‘alternative’ accomodation.</p>
<h3 id="Factory-behind-Lidl"><a href="#Factory-behind-Lidl" class="headerlink" title="Factory behind Lidl"></a>Factory behind Lidl</h3><p>Moved into an abandoned factory with a friend. We had a little camping gear and found a nice building made of wood, amongst the trees. Somehow, incredibly, he couldn’t keep the place clean– despite there being an enormous hole in the floor where we could just toss rubbish. This was beyond him.</p>
<h3 id="Dannis-House"><a href="#Dannis-House" class="headerlink" title="Dannis House"></a>Dannis House</h3><p>Moved in with an old street musician. This was a litany of small communication disasters.</p>
<h3 id="Henrietten-Str"><a href="#Henrietten-Str" class="headerlink" title="Henrietten Str."></a>Henrietten Str.</h3><p>Moved to a very regular WG. Was finishing my <a href="/Education#University_of_Leipzig">masters</a> at the time and therefore quite focussed.</p>
<h3 id="Merseburger-95-1"><a href="#Merseburger-95-1" class="headerlink" title="Merseburger 95"></a>Merseburger 95</h3><p>A room opened up in my partners flat and I took it. I stayed there for a year or so after that, my longest stay since <a href="/Reviews/Spaces/Urban/Cities#Merseburger108">merse 108</a>.</p>
<p>[^leipzig]: two weeks in <a href="/Chronology#2012-07">July 2012</a>, then from March 2013 till October 2018, minus ~1 month per year (travel or home in Scotland) ~&#x3D; 5 years and 2 months.<br>[^piano]: I moved my <a href="/Projects/Piano">piano</a> in first as I was planning to vacate the squat, and my partners mother said ‘be careful, first its the piano– he’ll come right after’. She was of course right on the money.</p>
