                <article class="markdown-body entry-content container-lg"><p>It is increasingly obvious that the toll of this year will be long and slow in the coming. You feel it in every little interaction, people are different. It will take people a long time, it will take society a long time, to recover. And if we are heading into a major economic recession, some things won&rsquo;t get the chance to recover for a decade or more.</p>
<hr>
<p>Apart from the obvious, it was a wonderful year for me. I started it in Leipzig as always, drinking beers on Eisenbahn with the Irish lads, talking to <a href="https://twitter.com/pfrazee">Paul Frazee</a> about transformative tech (I met him at the <a href="https://www.ccc.de/en/updates/2019/36c3-in-leipzig">CCC</a> and asked if he was doing anything for New Years Eve).</p>
<p>January and February were full of gigs and events (my third or fourth time attending the HGB Rundgang in Leipzig, my first visit to the Akademie in Vienna), and I started hanging out with my now flatmate Sophie. We discovered some very interesting bars and got picked up by all kinds of characters, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/herwigscherabon/">Herwig</a> being a fine example. I bought my finest jacket, a traditional Austrian leather tracht that must be a century old. I joined an art collective.</p>
<p>Just before the lockdown, I moved in with Sophie so we could save money for an apartment. Little did we know what would happen. I spent 10 weeks sleeping on her sofa in a 27m^2 apartment. We were both working and studying full time from there. It was intense. We watched some Gaspar Noe films and I learned 3D modeling in Blender. We studied some economics (specifically, I followed an economics 101 lecture series from MIT on youtube while playing Factorio for a weekend). I learned Javascript and the basics of web publishing.</p>
<p>Then the lockdown ended, and we moved into a beautiful Vienese apartment, 114m^2 (and vastly higher, the cubic meterage must be immense). We had some flatwarming parties. We got some flatmates.</p>
<p>I went to Scotland for a month to do some farming, and Sophie and Jurgen came with. We built a beautiful flight of stairs and started planning a residency.</p>
<p>Then it was September. September, October and November were largely taken up (besides work) with the collapse of my relationship with my then fiancee. We also had some nice dinner parties in our apartment, particularly the turkish dinner series cheffed by my brother, and semi-regular brunches. During this time I also had a wonderful weekend in east Germany with my collective, and I achieved my longest-ever water fast (10 days). There were many things in this month that I should write about in more detail at some point.</p>
<p>I worked as a python developer/devops engineer in a tech startup for the entire year. I am apparently not too bad at having a career, I got two raises and a promotion in the year, despite the dreaded &lsquo;rona. I got a lot of responsibility, and learned a great deal, not only about programming/systems engineering, but also about working with others, managing others, managing my time etc.</p>
<p>The emotional turmoil of the end of the year led me to take some time to consider my plans in some detail. I spent a lot of time talking with my friends, and realised more and more that I would like to go back and do a PhD. Then AlhpaFold cracked the protein folding problem. I feel more and more certain that this field is going to be incredibly exciting in the next decades.</p>
<p>I was in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5iDX4ocFjA">a quiz show</a>!</p>
<p>Finally, I came home to Scotland for my first Christmas at home in a very long time. (We tried to remember when it would have been, probably 2013.) I bought and played RimWorld.</p>
<p>All in all it has been a long and varied year with many ups and downs. Better than most people had I imagine.</p>
<hr>
<p>I worry very much about how we are all doing now. And how we will be doing by springtime. They have invented a new Tier of lockdown over here. They are desperately trying to keep us alive until the vaccine is ready.</p>
<p>I had what probably amounts to a massive breakdown this year, and I am not particularly prone to these things. This may have been on the cards, but it was no doubt hastened and worsened by the virus. I have no doubt that many people are suffering the same or worse, and the density and frequency of meltdowns is a very important factor in the functioning of a society.</p>
<p>Perhaps appropriately, this year I learned about Nick Land, and accelerationism. I learned that there are some who would like to push the self-destructive tendencies of capitalism to an extreme and watch it collapse. I feel like it is more possible than ever, in this tense and bitter air. Pent-up energies building into something.</p>
