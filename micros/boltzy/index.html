                <article class="markdown-body entry-content container-lg"><p>From a lecture by Boltzmann called simply &ldquo;THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The great query: whence do we come, whither will we go, has been discussed for thousands of years by the greatest of men of genius and turned this way and that with immense ingenuity; whether with any measure of success I  do not know, but certainly without any essential and undeniable progress: that was not attained until the present century, thanks to most careful studies and comparative experiments on the breeding of pigeons and other domestic animals, on the colouring of flying and swimming animals, by means of researches into the striking similarity of harmless to poisonous animals, through arduous comparisons of the shape of flowers with that of the in-sects that fertilize them. All these are indeed fields of apparently sub-ordinate importance, but in them genuine success could be attained which precisely became the solid operational basis for a campaign into the realm of metaphysics attended by success that is unique in the history of science.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The invention of a  dirigible airship is  hardly more than a  question of time. Nevertheless I think that it is not these achieve-ments that will put their stamp on our century: if you ask me for my in-nermost conviction whether it will one day be called the century of iron. or steam, or electricity, I answer without qualms that it will be named the century of the mechanical view of nature, of Darwin.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>After this confession you will take it with more tolerance if! am so bold as to claim your attention for a quite trifling and narrowly circumscribed question, nor will you accuse me of disregarding large and general ques-tions ifl tum to things that are as yet unrelated to them. In any case, treat-ing a narrowly circumscribed specialist topic before a wider public should not be entirely without interest. Indeed, the time is long past when a mortal could encompass all or even a fair number of branches of science; today we must limit ourselves not just to one definite branch but to a smal-lish part of one.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We infer the existence of things only from the impressions they make on our senses. It is thus one of the fairest triumphs of science if we succeed in inferring the existence of a large group of things that mostly escape our sense perception; thus astronomers, from often slight traces of light, were able with near certainty to infer the existence of many celestial bodies many of them a thousand and even a million times bigger than the earth and at distances that make the mind reel merely to think of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What astronomy has succeeded in doing for phenomena on the largest scale has similarly been achieved for the smallest dimensions. All observation points to things so small that only millions together can excite our senses. We call these things atoms and molecules. Conditions in the investigation of atoms are in many ways much less favourable still than in astronomy. We can always think of celestial bodies as being simi-lar to our earth; even if as regards size, state of aggregation, temperature, and so on, there are bound to be the most varied differences, we can still think of a mass of molten metal or large glowing spheres of gas, for which spectral analysis offers further clues. About the constitution of atoms, however, we know as yet nothing and will continue to do so until we succeed in formulating a  hypothesis from the facts observable by the senses.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That there are such tiny individual things whose joint effect first forms bodies perceivable by the senses is of course only a hypothesis; just as it is only a hypothesis that what we see in the sky is caused by celestial bodies of such size and distance, as indeed it is  basi-cally only a  hypothesis that besides myself there are other human beings that feel pleasure and pain, that there further exist animals, plants and mineral bodies. Perhaps one day a  hypothesis that the stars are mere sparks of light will explain celestial phenomena better than our current astronomy, but it is unlikely. Perhaps the atomistic hypothesis will one day be displaced by some other but it is  unlikely.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Purely thermal vibrations slip through our hands and escape our senses and are for us synonymous with rest; hence the thermal form of energy used often to be called dissipated or degraded energy, so that the second law proclaims a steady degradation of energy until all tensions that might still perform work and all visible motions in the universe would have to cease. All attempts at saving the universe from this thermal death have been unsuccessful, and to avoid raising hopes I cannot fulfi1, let me say at once that I  too shall here refrain from making such attempts. Rather my intention is merely to examine the second law a little more closely from another angle.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As is  well known, Buckle has shown by statistics that if only we take a large enough number of people, then so long as external circumstances do not change significantly, there is complete constancy not only in the processes determined by nature, such as number of deaths, diseases and so on, but also of the relative number of so-called voluntary actions such as marriage at a  certain age, crime, suicide and the like. Likewise with molecules:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>=======</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the heat produced by the Niagara falls is  already enough to drive a considerable proportion of all our machines, what inexhaustible supplies of energy would be at our disposal if we could transform all the heat con-tained in the bodies of our surroundings into work. Yet this cannot be done, because the energy they contain, except insofar as the sun might produce differences in temperature, is already almost in the most probable distribution, so that any attempt at distributing it in ways more suitable to our ends will fail.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Between sun and earth, however, there is  a colossal temperature difference; between these two bodies energy is thus not at all distributed according to the laws of probability. The equalisation of temperature, based on the tendency towards greater probability, takes millions of years, because the two bodies are so large and far apart. The intermediate forms assumed by solar energy, until it falls to terrestrial temperatures, can be fairly improbable, so that we can easily use the transition of heat from sun to earth for the performance of work,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The general struggle for existence of animate beings is therefore not a struggle for raw materials -  these, for organisms, are air, water and soil, all abundantly available -  nor for energy which exists in plenty in any body in the form of heat (albeit unfortunately not transformable), but a  struggle for en-tropy, which becomes available through the transition of energy from the hot sun to the cold earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to exploit this transition as much as possible, plants spread their immense surface ofleaves and force the sun&rsquo;s energy, before it falls to the earth&rsquo;s temperature, to perform in ways as yet unexplored certain chemical syntheses of which no one in our laboratories has so far the least idea. The products of this chemical kitchen constitute the object of struggle of the animal world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>=======</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since atoms have given such faithful service in all branches of physics and chemistry, the question arises whether it is likely or even possible that we can by their means explain the phenomena of animal life as well, that is thought and sensation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Still, the most direct path would be to start from our immediate sensations and to show how by means of them we attained knowledge of the universe. However, since this does not seem to lead to our goal, let us follow the inverse path of natural science. We frame the hypothesis that complexes of atoms had developed that were able to multiply by forming similar ones round them. Of the larger masses so arising the most viable were those that could multiply by division, and those that had a  tendency to move towards places where favourable conditions for life prevailed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This was greatly furthered by the receptivity for external impressions, chemical constitution and the motion of the circumambient medium, light and shade and so on. Sensitivity led to the development of sensory nerves, mobility to motor nerves; sensations that through inheritance led to constant strong compelling messages to the central agency to escape from them we call pain. Quite rough signs for external objects were left behind in the individual, they developed into complicated signs for complex situations and, if required, even to quite rough genuine internal imitations of the external, just as the algebrist can use arbitrary letters for magnitudes but usually prefers to choose the first letters of the corresponding words. If there is such a  developed memory sign for the individual himself, we define it  as consciousness. In this there is a continuous path from the closely connected clear conscious ideas to those stored in memory and to unconscious reflex movements. Does not our feeling tell us once more that consciousness is something quite different? However, I  have silenced feeling: if the hypothesis explains all the phenomena concerned, feeling will have to give way as in the question of the earth&rsquo;s rotation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It will be a  much later question, but one that can be solved only in this way, how from our sensations which are the simplest elements of our thinking we were able to reach hypotheses. However, I must end, lest I  become false to my resolution to leave metaphysics aside. Much of what I  have said may be mistaken, but all of it reflects my conviction. Only if each con-tinues to work where and how he is able, can we come nearer to truth; on-ly, as Schiller says, by &ldquo;busyness that never flags, that slowly forms but never destroys, that to the building of eternities brings grains of sand, yet from the heavy debt of time wipes minutes, days and years&rdquo;. Thus I  too shall be satisfied if my present lecture has contributed a grain of sand to the spread of the knowledge of nature.</p>
